                            pages (e.g: header, main, nav and footer elements),
                            with the Home page having a different layout from

                            attribute and pseudo-class selectors were used.

                            example, the various grid areas used different
                            flexbox stylings to adapt them to fit the layout as
                            it was intended to be.

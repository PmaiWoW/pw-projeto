                        Once an archangel was bored, so he decided to gather the
                        greatest warriors of all time and made them fight to the
                        death in different battlefields such as a viking ship
                        during a storm, tokyo city in the year 2154, a tavern in
                        the 9th century, a modern business office, etc.<br>
                        When other angels heard of the newest gambling game in
                        heaven their reaction was unanimous: “Bruhh!”.
